  abstract          = {With their distinctiveness and stability over time, fingerprints continue to be the most widely used anatomical characteristic in systems that automatically recognize a person's identity. This fully updated third edition provides in-depth coverage of the state-of-the-art in fingerprint recognition readers, feature extraction, and matching algorithms and applications. Deep learning (resurgence beginning around 2012) has been a game changer for artificial intelligence and, in particular, computer vision and biometrics. Performance improvements (both recognition accuracy and speed) for most biometric modalities can be attributed to the use of deep neural networks along with availability of large training sets and powerful hardware. Fingerprint recognition has also been approached by deep learning, resulting in effective and efficient methods for automated recognition and for learning robust fixed-length representations. However, the tiny ridge details in fingerprints known as minutiae are still competitive with the powerful representations learned by huge neural networks trained on big data. Features & Benefits: • Reflects the progress made in automated techniques for fingerprint recognition over the past five decades • Reviews the evolution of sensing technology: from bulky optical devices to in-display readers in smartphones • Dedicates an entire new chapter to latent fingerprint recognition, which is nowadays feasible in "lights-out" mode • Introduces classical and learning-based techniques for local orientation extraction, enhancement, and minutiae detection • Provides an updated review of presentation-attack-detection techniques and their performance evaluation • Discusses the evolution of minutiae matching from rich local descriptors to Minutiae Cylinder Code • Presents the development of feature-based matching: from FingerCode to handcrafted textural features to deep features • Reviews fingerprint synthesis, including recent Generative Adversarial Networks The revised edition of this must-read reference, written by leading international researchers, covers all critical aspects of fingerprint security system design and technology.

  abstract = {A critical step in automatic fingerprint matching is to automatically and reliably extract minutiae from the input fingerprint images. However, the performance of a minutiae extraction algorithm relies heavily on the quality of the input fingerprint images. In order to ensure that the performance of an automatic fingerprint identification/verification system will be robust with respect to the quality of input fingerprint images, it is essential to incorporate a fingerprint enhancement algorithm in the minutiae extraction module. We present a fast fingerprint enhancement algorithm, which can adaptively improve the clarity of ridge and valley structures of input fingerprint images based on the estimated local ridge orientation and frequency. We have evaluated the performance of the image enhancement algorithm using the goodness index of the extracted minutiae and the accuracy of an online fingerprint verification system. Experimental results show that incorporating the enhancement algorithm improves both the goodness index and the verification accuracy.},

A fingerprint recognition technology helps to overcome these technological barriers. A fingerprint recognition technology refers to the process of identifying or confirming the identity of an individual by comparing two fingerprints. It is the most researched and reliable biometric technique for identification and authentication. It is highly accurate, unique and can never be same to two persons. Fingerprint is the pattern that is found on the fingertip.

  abstract  = {We propose a fully automatic minutiae extractor, called MinutiaeNet, based on deep neural networks with compact feature representation for fast comparison of minutiae sets. Specifically, first a network, called CoarseNet, estimates the minutiae score map and minutiae orientation based on convolutional neural network and fingerprint domain knowledge (enhanced image, orientation field, and segmentation map). Subsequently, another network, called FineNet, refines the candidate minutiae locations based on score map. We demonstrate the effectiveness of using the fingerprint domain knowledge together with the deep networks. Experimental results on both latent (NIST SD27) and plain (FVC 2004) public domain fingerprint datasets provide comprehensive empirical support for the merits of our method. Further, our method finds minutiae sets that are better in terms of precision and recall in comparison with state-of-the-art on these two datasets. Given the lack of annotated fingerprint datasets with minutiae ground truth, the proposed approach to robust minutiae detection will be useful to train network-based fingerprint matching algorithms as well as for evaluating fingerprint individuality at scale. MinutiaeNet is implemented in Tensorflow: https://github.com/luannd/MinutiaeNet.},

  abstract  = {We present DeepPrint, a deep network, which learns to extract fixed-length fingerprint representations of only 200 bytes. DeepPrint incorporates fingerprint domain knowledge, including alignment and minutiae detection, into the deep network architecture to maximize the discriminative power of its representation. The compact, DeepPrint representation has several advantages over the prevailing variable length minutiae representation which (i) requires computationally expensive graph matching techniques, (ii) is difficult to secure using strong encryption schemes (e.g., homomorphic encryption), and (iii) has low discriminative power in poor quality fingerprints where minutiae extraction is unreliable. We benchmark DeepPrint against two top performing COTS SDKs (Verifinger and Innovatrics) from the NIST and FVC evaluations. Coupled with a re-ranking scheme, the DeepPrint rank-1 search accuracy on the NIST SD4 dataset against a gallery of 1.1 million fingerprints is comparable to the top COTS matcher, but it is significantly faster (DeepPrint: 98.80% in 0.3 seconds vs. COTS A: 98.85% in 27 seconds). To the best of our knowledge, the DeepPrint representation is the most compact and discriminative fixed-length fingerprint representation reported in the academic literature.},

  abstract  = {With the growing use of biometric authentication systems in the recent years, spoof fingerprint detection has become increasingly important. In this paper, we use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for fingerprint liveness detection. Our system is evaluated on the data sets used in the liveness detection competition of the years 2009, 2011, and 2013, which comprises almost 50 000 real and fake fingerprints images. We compare four different models: two CNNs pretrained on natural images and fine-tuned with the fingerprint images, CNN with random weights, and a classical local binary pattern approach. We show that pretrained CNNs can yield the state-of-the-art results with no need for architecture or hyperparameter selection. Data set augmentation is used to increase the classifiers performance, not only for deep architectures but also for shallow ones. We also report good accuracy on very small training sets (400 samples) using these large pretrained networks. Our best model achieves an overall rate of 97.1% of correctly classified samples-a relative improvement of 16% in test error when compared with the best previously published results. This model won the first prize in the fingerprint liveness detection competition 2015 with an overall accuracy of 95.5%.},

  abstract = {The topics of fingerprint classification, indexing, and retrieval have been studied extensively in the past decades. One problem faced by researchers is that in all publicly available fingerprint databases, only a few fingerprint samples from each individual are available for training and testing, making it inappropriate to use sophisticated statistical methods for recognition. Hence most of the previous works resorted to simple $k$-nearest neighbor ($k$-NN) classification. However, the $k$-NN classifier has the drawbacks of being comparatively slow and less accurate. In this paper, we tackle this problem by first artificially expanding the set of training samples using our previously proposed spatial modeling technique. With the expanded training set, we are then able to employ a more sophisticated classifier such as the Bayes classifier for recognition. We apply the proposed method to the problem of one-to-$N$ fingerprint identification and retrieval. The accuracy and speed are evaluated using the benchmarking FVC 2000, FVC 2002, and NIST-4 databases, and satisfactory retrieval performance is achieved. © 2010 IEEE.},

Such a characteristic leads to a restriction for the applications that can only operate on fixed-length binary data, such as cryptographic applications and certain biometric cryptosystems (e.g., fuzzy commitment). In this paper, we propose a generic point-to-string conversion framework for fingerprint minutia based on kernel learning methods to generate discriminative fixed length binary strings, which enables rapid matching. The proposed framework consists of four stages: 1) minutiae descriptor extraction; 2) a kernel transformation method that is composed of kernel principal component analysis or kernelized locality-sensitive hashing for fixed length vector generation; 3) a dynamic feature binarization; and 4) matching. The promising experimental results on six datasets from fingerprint verification competition (FVC)2002 and FVC2004 justify the feasibility of the proposed framework in terms of matching accuracy, efficiency, and template randomness.},

  abstract  = {Biometrics systems have significantly improved person identification and authentication, playing an important role in personal, national, and global security. However, these systems might be deceived (or spoofed) and, despite the recent advances in spoofing detection, current solutions often rely on domain knowledge, specific biometric reading systems, and attack types. We assume a very limited knowledge about biometric spoofing at the sensor to derive outstanding spoofing detection systems for iris, face, and fingerprint modalities based on two deep learning approaches. The first approach consists of learning suitable convolutional network architectures for each domain, whereas the second approach focuses on learning the weights of the network via back propagation. We consider nine biometric spoofing benchmarks - each one containing real and fake samples of a given biometric modality and attack type - and learn deep representations for each benchmark by combining and contrasting the two learning approaches. This strategy not only provides better comprehension of how these approaches interplay, but also creates systems that exceed the best known results in eight out of the nine benchmarks. The results strongly indicate that spoofing detection systems based on convolutional networks can be robust to attacks already known and possibly adapted, with little effort, to image-based attacks that are yet to come.},

  abstract = {Fingerprints are being extensively used for person identification in a number of commercial, civil, and forensic applications. Most of the current fingerprint verification systems utilize features that are based on minutiae points and ridge patterns. While minutiae based fingerprint verification systems have shown fairly high accuracies, further improvements in their performance are needed for acceptable performance, especially in applications involving very large scale databases. In an effort to extend the existing technology for fingerprint verification, we propose a new representation and matching scheme for fingerprint using Scale Invariant Feature Transformation (SIFT). We extract characteristic SIFT feature points in scale space and perform matching based on the texture information around the feature points using the SIFT operator. A systematic strategy of applying SIFT to fingerprint images is proposed. Using a public domain fingerprint database (FVC 2002), we demonstrate that the proposed approach complements the minutiae based fingerprint representation. Further, the combination of SIFT and conventional minutiae based system achieves significantly better performance than either of the individual schemes.},

Five processing blocks comprise the adaptive fingerprint enhancement method, where four of these blocks are updated in our proposed system. Hence, the proposed overall system is novel. The four updated processing blocks are: 1) preprocessing; 2) global analysis; 3) local analysis; and 4) matched filtering. In the preprocessing and local analysis blocks, a nonlinear dynamic range adjustment method is used. In the global analysis and matched filtering blocks, different forms of order statistical filters are applied.

  abstract  = {We present aDeep artificial neural network deep artificial neural network (DANN) model that learns latent fingerprint image patches using a stack ofRestricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs), and uses it to perform segmentation of latent fingerprint imagesArtificial neural networks. Artificial neural networks (ANN) are biologically inspired architectures that produce hierarchies of maps through learned weights or filters. Latent fingerprints are fingerprint impressions unintentionally left on surfaces at a crime scene. To make identifications or exclusions of suspects, Latent fingerprint latent fingerprint examiners analyze and compare latent fingerprints to known fingerprints of individuals. Due to the poor quality and often complex image background and overlapping patterns characteristic of latent fingerprint images, separating the fingerprint region of interest from complex image background and overlapping patterns is very challenging. Our proposed DANN model based on RBMs learnsFingerprint fingerprint image patches in two phases. The first phase (unsupervised pre-training) involves learning an identity mapping of the input image patches. In the second phase, fine-tuning and gradient updates are performed to minimize the cost function on the training dataset. The resulting trained model is used to classify the image patches into fingerprint and non-fingerprint classes. We use the fingerprint patches to reconstruct the latent fingerprint image and discard the non-fingerprint patches which contain the structured noise in the original latent fingerprint. The proposed model is evaluated by comparing the results from the state-of-the-art latent fingerprint segmentation models. The results of our evaluation show the superior performance of the proposed method.},

  abstract  = {Minutiae play a major role in fingerprint identification. Extracting reliable minutiae is difficult for latent fingerprints which are usually of poor quality. As the limitation of traditional handcrafted features, a fully convolutional network (FCN) is utilized to learn features directly from data to overcome complex background noises. Raw fingerprints are mapped to a correspondingly-sized minutia-score map with a fixed stride. And thus a large number of minutiae will be extracted through a given threshold. Then small regions centering at these minutia points are entered into a convolutional neural network (CNN) to reclassify these minutiae and calculate their orientations. The CNN shares convolutional layers with the fully convolutional network to speed up. 0.45 second is used on average to detect one fingerprint on a GPU. On the NIST SD27 database, we achieve 53\% recall rate and 53\% precise rate that outperform many other algorithms. Our trained model is also visualized to show that we have successfully extracted features preserving ridge information of a latent fingerprint.},

  abstract  = {Minutiae extraction is of critical importance in automated fingerprint recognition. Previous works on rolled/slap fingerprints failed on latent fingerprints due to noisy ridge patterns and complex background noises. In this paper, we propose a new way to design deep convolutional network combining domain knowledge and the representation ability of deep learning. In terms of orientation estimation, segmentation, enhancement and minutiae extraction, several typical traditional methods performed well on rolled/slap fingerprints are transformed into convolutional manners and integrated as an unified plain network. We demonstrate that this pipeline is equivalent to a shallow network with fixed weights. The network is then expanded to enhance its representation ability and the weights are released to learn complex background variance from data, while preserving end-to-end differentiability. Experimental results on NIST SD27 latent database and FVC 2004 slap database demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art minutiae extraction algorithms.
